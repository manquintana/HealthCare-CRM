# HealthCare-CRM

This project was part of Softtek's JAVA Bootcamp (1 month duration) and it's been done during February 2019, with JAVA + Spring as main technologies.

On a team of four interns, I assumed the role of project leader assigning tasks according to the experience of each one and tracking the progress to solve the technical problems with them and prevent delays into the weekly deliverable.

We finally achieved to deliver a fully functional product meeting all the requirements. After that, a place in the company was offered to me.
